# CUDA C Bitmap Experimental Library
Just an experimental Bitmap type that utilizes Nvidia's CUDA C to increase performance.

Not cross-os compatible, so try to only use Linux if you so happen to use this, you
mashochist. There are extra files that are part of this repo due to my use of CLion
and its need for extra files to make everything work properly. 

## Important Note
Keep in mind that this project is soley for learning CUDA C, the fundamentals of 
Parallel Programming, and how a GPU functions. Due to the nature of this, there 
will most likely be a lot of inefficient methods, or non-optimal ways of doing 
things, or even different yet similar functions having completely different 
implementations under the hood. I designed the Bitmap with what I was learning or
wanting to learn, not for the actual practical use of it.
