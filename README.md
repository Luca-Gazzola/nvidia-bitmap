# nvidia-bitmap
Just an experimental Bitmap type that utilizes Nvidia's CUDA C to increase performance.

Not cross-os compatible, so try to only use Linux if you so happen to use this, you
mashochist. There are extra files that are part of this repo due to my use of CLion
and its need for extra files to make everything work properly.

Please view the changelog for updates.
