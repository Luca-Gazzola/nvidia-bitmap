Merry Christmas!
I've successfully implemented all of Random Generation, optimized portions of my code,
and refactored some functions so that they are easier to read. I've also improved
testlogging so that it's now using a .csv format for easier and more organizing parsing
of results in another program like Excel (or Libre Office for me). Both Static and Random
generation having performant and non-performant tracking variants that can be selectively
used. Should be bug free, I hope. I'll continue with new generation types post New Year.

*This version does not have its own standalone version* 
Processor_Types to differentiate which hardware to use (CPU/GPU/Both) as well as a more 
in depth performance class have been implemented for easier testing and logging. Added 
more specialty logging to the test_wrapper.cpp so that I can now output testing data to 
a .csv file that can be read in excel which makes it easier to look through the massive 
amounts of data when I choose to increase the amount of tests ran (for more accurate numbers). 
Currently working on the the rest of the RandomGeneration implementation, GPU and CPU are 
already complete but the CPUtoGPU implementation is proving more difficult than expected. 
v1.03 will be pushed once I have finished this last implementation, and added non 
performance-tracking variants to the project.

I have added performance logging to the Bitmap class. It should now be easier to test the
performance of the class, as well as routing that information somewhere (like a document
instead of just the terminal). The constructors have been modified to have a default bool
in each that allows for performance use (shouldn't affect constructors already used), as
well as changing all unsigned int types to int due to my use of the explicit keyword for
construction. Added some slight QoL stuff for now, which might be removed later like the
Macros for my Bitmap enums (I don't know the precedent for this, and whether or not wise
to do it so I'll be careful about using the macros). I've expanded the tests so that it
will log the performance of the Bitmap class as well.

After coming across a paper online titled "A Comparison of CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and Massively
Parallel Processor Arrays for Random Number Generation" by David B. Thomas, Lee Howes, and 
Wayne Luk. It states that the CPU is still incredibly powerful, if not more than the GPU when
it comes to an Random Number Generator. I created a CPU variant of the RNG to compete against
the GPU. I utilize the CUDA Texture feature since I'm essentially creating a bitmap in the 
CPU, then copying the information from the CPU to the GPU, processing it there, then returning
the processed bitmap back into the class.

28.11.2018 - 1.01b
Discovered that the issue is not my optimization of the launched kernels by the initialization
of my random number generator. I've changed it so that my offset is now 0, and uniquely seeds
the kernel by the ID of the thread instead (basically moved the offset to the seed). Now it
works but the launched kernels now run slower, but the initialization is a lot faster as well.
Shared memory is not possible in this state of the project as it's not very useful right now.

27.11.2018 - 1.01
Finished implementing 4:1 unrolling per thread. The width of the launched blocks/threads is one
fourth of the original dimensions of the bitmap image. Hopefully this unrolling optimized the
creation of the pixels. Planning on adding a shared memory cache per block to maybe increase
efficiency? If anything it'll help with learning how to use shared memory.

21.11.2018 - 1.00
I recently moved all of the files in the test_wrapper project to this new 
"../Development/Projects/Bitmap/". I personally wanted to improve the Bitmap project since it's 
actually fun to work with and involves a lot of problem solving in order to do what I want. This 
is basically a larger project made just for fun. If I do manage to get it working without any 
issues, it's a good way to generate some Bitmaps I guess. This version also has an actual file 
structure!
