Happy Birthday to me. And I'm here again, working at the lab. I really don't have
anything to do I guess. I've added point-wise multiplication and division in
non-performant and performant tracking variants. I have discovered an issue with
my copy constructor that I will need to fix, but that's for another time. For the
time being, the modifications that I've wanted to add are now fully implemented.
From this point, it's about fixing what I can then seeing if I want to continue.
I've also modified my bitmap_resources so that it is more clear about what names
belong to what namespaces.

Only really important to the repository itself. I just removed several files and
directories due to their unimportance. They are just there due to a full upload
of the project. I may re-introduce the testlogs directory for the sake of reports
and whatnot, but for the time being it's not very important.

Happy Valentines Day, and I'm here in lab working on this project because why not.
Anyways, I've added full Subtraction functionality including performant and 
non-performant tracking, as well as using operator- on the Bitmap. It's also
possible to use a constant on the Bitmap as well. Addition and Subtraction should
now be fully working. I've also modified many different aspects of the Bitmap
class as well, including the way Bitmaps are made (MakeBitmap) and drawn (new
function called DrawBitmap). Various logic changes have been made, and hopefully
all affected code should be properly fixed so that it works with the new logic.

13.02.2019 - 1.06a
After pushing the last major update, I've added a variant of Addition that now allows
it to add all pixels by a single constant number. I've decided to add this feature to
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. It's a minor update, with only
this feature so...yeah.

13.02.2019 - 1.06
After a nice week long break post-presentation, I've come back to again work on this
class because why not, I don't have anything else to do right now. I've finished off
the non-tracking Addition, as well as added a Subtraction variant (performant and
non-performant tracking). Apparently there was an issue using the Matrix Multiplication
that I wasn't aware of, just a minor warning regarding a temporary address usage, which
is now fixed. Given that I don't have any other work given to me, or materials to
teach myself new things, I'll continue working on this project for the time being.

24.01.2019 - 1.05a
Due to realizing that the GPU crashes when Matrix Multiplication is running for a
prolonged period of time, I have tried to be more careful when using my stack allocated
memory. While it has improved only slightly, it will still crash if the program is
running for too long despite having no leaks. This is due to the way the GPU retains
memory through the programs life cycle. For the time being, I can't fix this. I've
also added better arg functionality when running this through the Makefile. Now you can
put any amount of args (below 6) in any order rather than having to follow a specific
one.

23.01.2019 - 1.05
I have finished off the Matrix Multiplication function by fixing various logic errors
and memory issues, and by adding a non-performant tracking variant as well. I've added
Matrix Addition to at least introduce a new algorithm to base my testing off of due to
my abstract on my work is due tomorrow. This update is really a patch and update in one
since I didn't take the time to push my changes earlier to my repo. Procrastination sure 
is something. 

17.01.2019 - 1.04
New year, new version!
After some time off, and of course developing the new version, I have added a new
Matrix Multiplication function out of nowhere! Truth be told it was fairly relevant 
that I added the code to ensure that I have at least something a bit more advanced-ish
that I can show to some people in my lab. I still have to add a non-performant tracking
variant for practicality sake. It's important to note that I'll be continuing to work on 
this project probably up until the 5th of Feburaury since I will basically be presenting 
all of my CUDA C and GPU knowledge, which is basically this project. We'll see if I
decide to keep working on this project for the giggles.

Merry Christmas!
I've successfully implemented all of Random Generation, optimized portions of my code,
and refactored some functions so that they are easier to read. I've also improved
testlogging so that it's now using a .csv format for easier and more organizing parsing
of results in another program like Excel (or Libre Office for me). Both Static and Random
generation having performant and non-performant tracking variants that can be selectively
used. Should be bug free, I hope. I'll continue with new generation types post New Year.

13.12.2018 - 1.02b
*This version does not have its own standalone version* 
Processor_Types to differentiate which hardware to use (CPU/GPU/Both) as well as a more 
in depth performance class have been implemented for easier testing and logging. Added 
more specialty logging to the test_wrapper.cpp so that I can now output testing data to 
a .csv file that can be read in excel which makes it easier to look through the massive 
amounts of data when I choose to increase the amount of tests ran (for more accurate numbers). 
Currently working on the the rest of the RandomGeneration implementation, GPU and CPU are 
already complete but the CPUtoGPU implementation is proving more difficult than expected. 
v1.03 will be pushed once I have finished this last implementation, and added non 
performance-tracking variants to the project.

06.12.2018 - 1.02a
I have added performance logging to the Bitmap class. It should now be easier to test the
performance of the class, as well as routing that information somewhere (like a document
instead of just the terminal). The constructors have been modified to have a default bool
in each that allows for performance use (shouldn't affect constructors already used), as
well as changing all unsigned int types to int due to my use of the explicit keyword for
construction. Added some slight QoL stuff for now, which might be removed later like the
Macros for my Bitmap enums (I don't know the precedent for this, and whether or not wise
to do it so I'll be careful about using the macros). I've expanded the tests so that it
will log the performance of the Bitmap class as well.

After coming across a paper online titled "A Comparison of CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and Massively
Parallel Processor Arrays for Random Number Generation" by David B. Thomas, Lee Howes, and 
Wayne Luk. It states that the CPU is still incredibly powerful, if not more than the GPU when
it comes to an Random Number Generator. I created a CPU variant of the RNG to compete against
the GPU. I utilize the CUDA Texture feature since I'm essentially creating a bitmap in the 
CPU, then copying the information from the CPU to the GPU, processing it there, then returning
the processed bitmap back into the class.

28.11.2018 - 1.01a
Discovered that the issue is not my optimization of the launched kernels by the initialization
of my random number generator. I've changed it so that my offset is now 0, and uniquely seeds
the kernel by the ID of the thread instead (basically moved the offset to the seed). Now it
works but the launched kernels now run slower, but the initialization is a lot faster as well.
Shared memory is not possible in this state of the project as it's not very useful right now.

27.11.2018 - 1.01
Finished implementing 4:1 unrolling per thread. The width of the launched blocks/threads is one
fourth of the original dimensions of the bitmap image. Hopefully this unrolling optimized the
creation of the pixels. Planning on adding a shared memory cache per block to maybe increase
efficiency? If anything it'll help with learning how to use shared memory.

21.11.2018 - 1.00
I recently moved all of the files in the test_wrapper project to this new 
"../Development/Projects/Bitmap/". I personally wanted to improve the Bitmap project since it's 
actually fun to work with and involves a lot of problem solving in order to do what I want. This 
is basically a larger project made just for fun. If I do manage to get it working without any 
issues, it's a good way to generate some Bitmaps I guess. This version also has an actual file 
structure!
